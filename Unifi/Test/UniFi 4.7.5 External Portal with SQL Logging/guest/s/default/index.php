					<p>Terms of Agreement</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
				<p>By accessing the wireless network, you acknowledge that you're of legal age, you have read and understood and agree to be bound by this agreement
				This is an agreement between you and LeGrove Apartments Watford and its affiliates ("LeGrove Apartments Watford", "we", or "us") for 802.11b/g/n wireless and broadband communications services and related services and features (the "Service").</p>
				<li><b>Service Availability:</b> An 802.11b/g/n and/or Ethernet-compatible computer, card, and/or device ("Unit") are required to enable the Service to operate. You are responsible for ensuring the compatibility of your Unit with the Service. The availability and performance of the Service is subject to all memory, storage and other limitations in the Unit. Service is available to your Unit only when it is within the operating range of our system and/or directly connected. Service is subject to unavailability, including unavailability due to emergencies, collocation failures, transmission and equipment limitations, or maintenance and repair, and may be interrupted, refused, limited or curtailed. We are not responsible for data, messages or pages that you may lose or that become misdirected because of interruptions or performance issues with the Service or wireless communications networks generally. We may impose usage or Service limits, Suspend Service, or block certain kinds of usage in our sole discretion to protection users or our business. Network speed is no indication of the speed at which your Unit or the Service sends or receives data. Actual network speed will vary based on unit configuration, compression and network congestion.
				</li>
				<li><b>Use of Service:</b> You agree not to resell any aspect of the Service, whether for profit or otherwise, or to authorize any other individual or entity to use the Service. You agree not to use the Service or your Unit for any fraudulent, unlawful, harassing or abusive purposes, or in such a way as to create damage or risk to our business, reputation, employees, subscribers, facilities, and third parties or the public generally. You agree that sharing the Service with another party breaches the Agreement and may constitute fraud or theft, for which LeGrove Apartments Watford reserves the rights set forth herein and all other legal and equitable remedies. You agree that you will not use the Service or your Unit to send any illegal, harassing, threatening, obscene, offensive or unsolicited commercial text or e-mail messages or to intentionally transmit any computer viruses.
				</li>
				<li><b>Content Disclaimer:</b> Cautions or Restrictions. LeGrove Apartments Watford does not control, nor is it in any way liable for, data or content that you can access or receive via the Service.
